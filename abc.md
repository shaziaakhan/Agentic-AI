**Detailed Anomaly Analysis:**

The following describes the nature of each anomaly and suggested actions:

*   **INV-008 (Discount):** Discounts typically require a corresponding purchase order or justification. Verify the discount's validity and supporting documentation.
*   **INV-009 (Refund):** Refunds should be cross-referenced with original purchase invoices. Verify the original transaction and refund authorization.
*   **INV-013 (Adjustment):** Adjustments need clear explanations. Investigate the reason for the adjustment and ensure it's properly authorized.
*   **INV-016 (Penalty):** Penalties should be linked to specific contract terms or agreements. Confirm the penalty's legitimacy and the triggering event.
*   **INV-019 (Credit):** Credits need to be associated with a previous overpayment or return. Validate the credit's origin and application.

**Recommendations:**

*   Investigate the root cause of invalid invoices to prevent future occurrences.
*   Implement stricter validation rules to catch anomalies earlier in the process.
*   Establish a clear process for handling and resolving invalid invoices.
*   Ensure proper documentation is maintained for all invoices, especially those with discounts, refunds, adjustments, penalties, or credits.
